# Precision-Recall

### 1

Questions 1 to 5 refer to the following scenario:

Suppose a binary classifier produced the following confusion matrix.

Predicted Positive	Predicted Negative
Actual Positive	5600	40
Actual Negative	1900	2460
What is the precision of this classifier? Round your answer to 2 decimal places.


0.75


### 2

### 5

Refer to the scenario presented in Question 1 to answer the following:

Which of the following best describes this classifier?


>It is optimistic


It is pessimistic


None of the above

### 6

Suppose we are fitting a logistic regression model on a dataset where the vast majority of the data points are labeled as positive. To compensate for overfitting to the dominant class, we should


>Require higher confidence level for positive predictions


Require lower confidence level for positive predictions

### 7

It is often the case that false positives and false negatives incur different costs. In situations where false negatives cost much more than false positives, we should


Require higher confidence level for positive predictions


>Require lower confidence level for positive predictions

### 8

We are interested in reducing the number of false negatives. Which of the following metrics should we primarily look at?


Accuracy


Precision


>Recall

### 9

Suppose we set the threshold for positive predictions at 0.9. What is the lowest score that is classified as positive? Round your answer to 2 decimal places.
