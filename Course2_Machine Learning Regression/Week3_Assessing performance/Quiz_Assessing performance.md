# Assessing Performance

### 1

If the features of Model 1 are a strict subset of those in Model 2, the TRAINING error of the two models can never be the same.


True


>False

### 2

If the features of Model 1 are a strict subset of those in Model 2, which model will USUALLY have lowest TRAINING error?


Model 1


>Model 2


It's impossible to tell with only this information


### 3

If the features of Model 1 are a strict subset of those in Model 2. which model will USUALLY have lowest TEST error?


Model 1


Model 2


>It's impossible to tell with only this information


### 4

If the features of Model 1 are a strict subset of those in Model 2, which model will USUALLY have lower BIAS?


Model 1


>Model 2

### 7

It is always optimal to add more features to a regression model.


True


>False


### 8

A simple model with few parameters is most likely to suffer from:


>High Bias


High Variance


### 9

A complex model with many parameters is most likely to suffer from:


High Bias


>High Variance


### 10

A model with many parameters that fits training data very well but does poorly on test data is considered to be


accurate


biased


>overfitted


poorly estimated


### 11

A common process for selecting a parameter like the optimal polynomial degree is:


Bootstrapping


Model estimation


Multiple regression


Minimizing test error


>Minimizing validation error


### 12

Selecting model complexity on test data (choose all that apply):


>Allows you to avoid issues of overfitting to training data


>Provides an overly optimistic assessment of performance of the resulting model


Is computationally inefficient


Should never be done

### 13

Which of the following statements is true (select all that apply): For a fixed model complexity, in the limit of an infinite amount of training data,


The noise goes to 0


Bias goes to 0


>Variance goes to 0


Training error goes to 0


Generalization error goes to 0
